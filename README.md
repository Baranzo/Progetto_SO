FOR MAKEFILE USE:

For generate the complete core for UARM just type  " make " without argument and the makefile automatically
generate the core file from p1test.c .

If you want to delete all file created during the generating process type " make cleanall ".

If you wanto to build the core from another file modify the FILE macro inside the makefile file, I'm working
on the automated way to do this and other impossible stuff :)
